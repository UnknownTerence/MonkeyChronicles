### Combat 
- Some of Daniel's ideas... perhaps this game could be some sort of rogue like, where you collect different weapons and resources. However, MOST IMPORTANTLY: combat should be difficult and tiring, no NPC type encounters but more like you're fighting real people that know how to counter your attacks. There should not be a health bar..maybe an energy bar. The length of the energy bar represents the health you have, the energy bar represents your endurance from attacks. This creates a necessity for strafing.
- Sword/arm movement is controlled with the mouse...energy level dictates responsiveness. to parry, swing outwards in the direction of the parry. to attack, swing inwards in the direction of attacks.
